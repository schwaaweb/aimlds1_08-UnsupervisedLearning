    "# Clustering text documents using k-means\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is commonly used to create classifications for written text using Natural Language Processing ([NLP](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ml/sprint/recelerz9zemekmia)) techniques. This approach is highlighted by a combination of supervised and unsupervised techniques - given a huge (and growing) corpus of literature, it may be very hard for observers to classify each document. A clustering approach allows classes to be generated automatically, grouping each document into like clusters. Then, researchers may fit the clustering to specific documents that they wish to get better insigned into. Any document that shares a cluster with the tagged documents of interest then becomes a document of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this CC, we will do feature extraction and clustering on a collection of newgroup documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text documents are not directly classifiable by ML algorithms, the must first be \"Vectorized\", that is, turned into numerical vectors by some process. Then each document becomes (as you are now familiar with) a single point in a high dimensional space. Then k-Means or any other ML algorithm can be used for processing. Vectorizing the documents is also called \"feature extraction\": using either of the two below algorithms a text file is converted into a set of features, aka a numerical row in a database, aka a single sample of `X`, aka a point in a high dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two feature extraction methods can be used in this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [TfidfVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) ([Term-Frequency Inverse-Document Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)) uses a in-memory vocabulary (a python dict) to map the most frequent words to features indices and hence compute a word occurrence frequency (sparse) matrix. The word frequencies are then reweighted using the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) vector collected feature-wise over the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [HashingVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer.html) hashes word occurrences to a fixed dimensional space, possibly with collisions. The word count vectors are then normalized to each have l2-norm equal to one (projected to the euclidean unit-ball) which seems to be important for k-means to work in high dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    HashingVectorizer does not provide IDF weighting as this is a stateless\n",
    "    model (the fit method does nothing). When IDF weighting is needed it can\n",
    "    be added by pipelining its output to a TfidfTransformer instance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Try both of these feature extractors and compare them:"
